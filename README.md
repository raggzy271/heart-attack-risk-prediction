# Heart Attack Risk Prediction
This is a very small MATLAB project which, given a patient's blood pressure and cholesterol, predicts his or her risk of having a heart attack.

The code uses k-Means Clustering to identify each patient's risk of heart attack (could be either high or low).

## Check https://in.mathworks.com/help/stats/kmeans.html to understand k-Means Clustering.
